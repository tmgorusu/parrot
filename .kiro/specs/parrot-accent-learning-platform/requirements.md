# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Parrot is an educational platform that leverages LLMs, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and voice conversion technologies to enhance pronunciation and accent learning in an interactive, user-friendly environment. The platform provides personalized voice cloning, real-time phoneme-level feedback, and interactive conversational scenarios to help users improve their accent and pronunciation skills.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Voice Cloning and Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a voice snippet to create a personalized voice model, so that the system can provide tailored accent training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an audio file THEN the system SHALL accept files up to 30 seconds in duration
2. WHEN audio is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process it at 16kHz quality
3. WHEN voice processing is complete THEN the system SHALL create a personalized voice model using E2E voice conversion
4. WHEN voice cloning is successful THEN the system SHALL store the voice embeddings securely with encryption
5. IF voice processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback and retry options

### Requirement 2: Interactive Accent Training Scenarios

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to practice accent training through real-world conversational scenarios, so that I can improve my pronunciation in practical contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts training THEN the system SHALL provide interactive scenarios (café orders, interviews, etc.)
2. WHEN a scenario is selected THEN the system SHALL generate conversational prompts using LLM integration
3. WHEN a user speaks during training THEN the system SHALL capture audio via WebRTC at 16kHz
4. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL process it through Whisper-tiny for transcription
5. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL perform phoneme alignment using Montreal Forced Aligner

### Requirement 3: Real-time Phoneme-Level Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback on my pronunciation at the phoneme level, so that I can understand exactly what to improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN phoneme analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visualization via accuracy heatmap
2. WHEN pronunciation errors are detected THEN the system SHALL generate natural language feedback using LLM
3. WHEN feedback is generated THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations (e.g., "raise your tongue slightly")
4. WHEN user speaks THEN the system SHALL display real-time amplitude visualization for confidence building
5. IF user activates panic toggle THEN the system SHALL instantly mute feedback to reduce anxiety

### Requirement 4: Accent Customization and Blending

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize and blend different accents, so that I can achieve my specific pronunciation goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses accent settings THEN the system SHALL provide gradient tokens from VCTK, Common Voice, and Arabic Dialect Corpus
2. WHEN accent blending is requested THEN the system SHALL provide precise control interface for accent mixing
3. WHEN accent parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL apply changes using the accent stylizer
4. WHEN accent customization is saved THEN the system SHALL store preferences in the user profile
5. IF accent similarity metric is calculated THEN the system SHALL achieve ≥ 0.75 cosine similarity using wav2vec embeddings
